/* DAY 26: Exploring threading
 *
 * Import the threading module.
 * Define a function called `task` that simulates a task by printing a message and sleeping for a short duration. 
 * Create two threads using `threading.Thread(target=task, name="Thread 1")` and `threading.Thread(target=task, name="Thread 2")`.
 * Start both threads using `thread1.start()` and `thread2.start()`.
 * Wait for the threads to complete using `thread1.join()` and `thread2.join()`.
 * Print a message indicating that all threads have completed.

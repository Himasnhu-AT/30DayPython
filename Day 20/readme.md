# Day 20

## Summary

This day explores working with external APIs. We will learn how to interact with APIs using libraries like `requests` in Python. Understand the concepts of API endpoints, request methods (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE), headers, and responses. We will build simple applications that retrieve and process data from external APIs.

## Relevance to Future Projects

Understanding APIs is essential for building modern applications. Many services and platforms provide APIs to access their data and functionality. By learning how to work with APIs, you can create applications that integrate with other systems, automate tasks, and build powerful tools.

/* DAY 22: Working with SQL and Python for database interaction.
 *
 * In this task, you'll write SQL queries to interact with a database and use Python to execute them.
 * You'll start by connecting to the database, creating a table, inserting data, retrieving data, updating data, and finally deleting data.
 *
 *  Connect to a SQLite database (you'll need to create the 'students.db' file if it doesn't exist) using the `sqlite3` module in Python.
 *  Create a table named 'students' with columns for 'id', 'name', and 'age'.
 *  Insert three new student records into the 'students' table.
 *  Retrieve all student records from the 'students' table and print them to the console.
 *  Update the age of a specific student in the 'students' table.
 *  Retrieve the updated student record and print it to the console.
 *  Delete a student record from the 'students' table.
 *  Retrieve all student records again and print them to the console.
 *
 *  Remember to close the database connection when you're finished.

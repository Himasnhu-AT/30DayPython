# Data Structures

# Lists
# Create a list of your favorite fruits and print the length of the list.
# Then, add another fruit to the list and print it.

# Dictionaries
# Create a dictionary storing your name and age, then print the value associated with the "name" key.

# Tuples
# Create a tuple of numbers, then attempt to modify the first element. Observe the error message.

# Sets
# Create a set of your favorite colors and print the set. Add a duplicate color to the set - what happens?

# Control Flow

# Conditional Statements (if-else)
# Write a function that checks if a number is even or odd.

# Loops (for, while)
# Use a for loop to print the numbers from 1 to 10.
# Use a while loop to count from 0 to 5, printing each number.

# Functions

# Define a function that takes two numbers as arguments and returns their sum.

# Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)

# Define a class named "Car" with attributes like "brand" and "model". Add a method named "start_engine" that prints a message.

# File Handling

# Write a program that writes a sentence to a file named "day29_output.txt", then read the content back from the file.

# Exception Handling

# Define a function that divides two numbers, raising a custom exception called "DivideByZeroError" if the divisor is zero.

# Modules and Packages

# Import the "random" module and generate a random number between 1 and 100.

# Write your code below this line

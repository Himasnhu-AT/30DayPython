# Day 23: Networking with Sockets

## Summary
This day delves into the realm of network programming with Python. You'll learn about sockets, which are the building blocks for communication between programs across a network. We'll explore the concepts of client-server architecture and create simple client-server applications using sockets. 

You'll discover how to establish connections, send and receive data, and close connections using sockets. This foundation will be valuable for developing various network applications, including chat programs, web servers, and distributed systems.

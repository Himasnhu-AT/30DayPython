# /* DAY 30: Build a simple text-based adventure game in Python.
#  *
#  * Design a game with a storyline, locations, characters, inventory, and user interactions.
#  *
#  * Remember to implement:
#  *   - Game Data: Use data structures (e.g., lists, dictionaries) to store information about locations, characters, items, and the player.
#  *   - Functions: Define functions for specific actions (e.g., moving between locations, interacting with characters, managing inventory).
#  *   - Loops: Use loops for game flow, player input, or repeating actions.
#  *   - Conditional Statements: Implement game logic with if/elif/else for decisions based on player choices and game state.
#  *   - Input/Output: Use input() for player input and print() for game output.

# /* DAY 5: Let's work with functions in Python!
#  *
#  * You're going to define three functions:
#  *
#  *   - `square_number(x)`: Takes an integer `x` and returns its square.
#  *   - `uppercase(text)`: Takes a string `text` and returns it in uppercase.
#  *   - `half_the_number(x)`: Takes an integer `x` and returns half of its value.
#  *
#  * You'll also use the `input()` function to get an integer from the user and call your functions with it.

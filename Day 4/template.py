# /* DAY 4: Loops - Your turn to code!
#  *
#  * 1. For Loop:
#  *   - Create a list named 'my_list' containing the numbers 1 through 5.
#  *   - Use a 'for' loop to iterate through the list and print each item.
#  *
#  * 2. While Loop:
#  *   - Create a variable named 'counter' and set it to 1.
#  *   - Use a 'while' loop to count from 1 to 5.
#  *   - Inside the loop, print the value of 'counter' and then increment it by 1.

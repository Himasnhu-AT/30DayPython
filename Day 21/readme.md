# Day 21: Dive into Databases with SQLite

## Summary

Today, we're diving into the world of databases! You'll learn the fundamentals of database concepts like tables, rows, columns, and queries. We'll be using the powerful `sqlite3` library in Python to interact with SQLite databases. This knowledge will be crucial as you build more complex applications that need to store and retrieve data efficiently. 

Imagine creating a to-do list app, a simple inventory system, or a mini-social media platform. These applications all require a database to manage their data. SQLite is a lightweight, embedded database that's perfect for these types of applications, and it's often used by mobile apps and desktop applications.

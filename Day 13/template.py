/* DAY 13: Exploring data structures in Python: Tuples, Sets, and Frozen Sets
 *
 * 1. Create a tuple named 'my_tuple' with the following elements: 1, 2, 3, "a", "b"
 * 2. Print the first element of 'my_tuple'.
 * 3. Print the fourth element of 'my_tuple'.
 * 4. Create a set named 'my_set' with the following elements: 1, 2, 3, "a", "b"
 * 5. Check if '1' is in 'my_set' and print an appropriate message.
 * 6. Create two sets named 'set1' and 'set2' with elements: set1 = {1, 2, 3} and set2 = {3, 4, 5}
 * 7. Calculate the union of 'set1' and 'set2' and store it in a new set named 'union_set'. Print the 'union_set'.
 * 8. Calculate the intersection of 'set1' and 'set2' and store it in a new set named 'intersection_set'. Print the 'intersection_set'.
 * 9. Calculate the difference of 'set1' and 'set2' and store it in a new set named 'difference_set'. Print the 'difference_set'.
 * 10. Create a frozen set named 'my_frozenset' with the following elements: 1, 2, 3.
 * 11. Print the 'my_frozenset'.
